# Good Feet Review Analysis using Naive Bayes Classification
 Analysis of customer reviews from the Good Feet Milwaukee store to predict review score. This is a very simple analysis using a very small amount of data to demonstrate my knowledge on machine learning. The Good Feet Store serves it's customers with custom fitted arch supports, shoe inserts, and a small selection of shoes that claim to alleviate foot, knee, hip and back pain. Their average rating on Google Reviews is a 3.9.

# Problem Definition and Goals
The purpose of this analysis is to classify reviews by their star rating given their text review using a Naive Bayes Classifier. This data was scraped from the Good Feet Milwaukee location's Google reviews page using Outscraper. The raw data was then cleaned to only contain the following variables of 121 observations:
- review_ID
- review_text
- review_rating
- review_datetime_utc
- review_likes

# Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The distribution of the review ratings can be shown by the below barplot. To improve the accuracy of the model since we have a small amount of observations, the star ratings were combined into "good" and "bad" ratings. It would be very difficult for the model to accurately classify the individual star ratings (such as 2-4 stars) because there is less than 10 observations in those variables and the model would be more biased towards predicting the 5-star reviews that have around 70 observations. Therefore, for this analysis, 4 stars and below are considered good, while 3 stars and below are considered bad. The next figure shows the combined binary ratings. It is shown that there are much more good ratings than bad ones. 

### Original Barplot of 1-5 Star Ratings

### Modified "Good" and "Bad" Ratings

I also took a look at the distribution of the dates of each review by individually plotting the year of review and month of review. It is shown that the majority of reviews were made in 2019 and the month of October in the below figures.

### Review Months

Next the good and bad review frequent words were visualized using the WordCloud package.

Before training the Naive Bayes Classifier the data was converted into a text corpus. The tm and SnowballC packages were used in this process. The corpus was cleaned by converting all words to lowercase, removing all numbers, stopwords, replacing punctuations with spaces, stemming, and striping the remaining white space. The clean corpus was then converted into a document term matrix to get the frequencies of each word. The matrix is very sparse so words that appeared less than five times were also removed. The text was then split into about 80% training and 20% testing data initially, then into 60% and 40% to view any changes. We obtained the best model using 10-fold cross validation and evaluted using AUC/ROC. 

# Data Analysis and Experimental Results

The data was trained using a Naive Bayes Classifier using the caret package. Below are the initial results before using 10-fold cross validation and with 80/20 training/test data. This model did not do as well with predicting Bad reviews:

Below are the results of the final model using 60/40 training/testing data and using 10-fold cross validation evaluated with ROC. We can see that this model did a better job at classifying bad reviews. The AUC of this model came to be 0.706 which was calculated using the ROCR package. Meaning that there is about a 70% chance that this model will accurately distinguish between good and bad reviews.

 # Conclusion
 
According to the Better Business Bureau, this Good Feet Store location opened in 2001 with reviews starting on Google in 2013. The majority of ratings on Google were 5-star reviews with most dates in 2019. For this analysis, 1 through 3 star ratings were grouped as bad, and 4 to 5 star ratings were good. A Naive Bayes binary classification model was trained using 60% of the data, with the last 40% for testing. 10 fold cross validation was used to find the best model which was able to classify the correct review rating about 70% of the time. The accuracy of the model could be improved by using a larger dataset with a bigger distribution of balanced ratings.
